Traditionally, the CoreNG repo is built using the Eclipse IDE.  If that
is to your liking, then by all means go ahead and do so.

This fork of the CoreNG sources may also be built using the
[scons](http://scons.org/) command line tool,

1. Should your system lack Python 2.x, download and install it.

2. Download and install [scons](http://scons.org/).  Version 2.3.5 or
   later is required.

3. Install the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) application.
   Versions 1.5.8beta is known to work.  You will merely be using the
   gcc-arm toolchain installed with/by the Arduino application.
   
4. Run the Arduino application and install the ARM programming tools.
   Look under "Tools > Board > Boards Manager...".  Select the "Arduino
   SAM Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-M3) by Arduino" and install it.

5. From this github repository, edit the file

         sample_rrf_arduino_paths.py

   as appropriate to indicate the location of your installed Arduino
   application and gcc tools.  Then save this file to your home directory
   as the file

         ~/.rrf_arduino_paths.py

6. From the top-level CoreNG repository directory, build the
   library for Duet with the command

         scons install

   For RADDS, instead use the command

        scons install platform=RADDS

   Once scons finishes a build, the resulting library will be the file

        Release/libCoreDuet.a

   or

        Release/libCoreRadds.a
